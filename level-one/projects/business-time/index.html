                    <h3>Early Gold Finds and Production</h3>
                    <p>Gold was produced in the southern Appalachian region as early as 1792 and perhaps as early as 1775 in
                        southern California.
                        The discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in California sparked the gold rush of 1849-50, and hundreds of
                        mining camps
                        sprang to life as new deposits were discovered. Gold production increased rapidly. Deposits in the
                        Mother Lode and Grass Valley
                        districts in California and the Comstock Lode in Nevada were discovered during the 1860's, and the
                        Cripple Creek deposits in
                        Colorado began to produce gold in 1892. By 1905 the Tonopah and Goldfield deposits in Nevada and the
                        Alaskan placer deposits
                        had been discovered, and United States gold production for the first time exceeded 4 million troy ounces
                        a year--a level maintained until 1917.</p>
        
                    <p>During World War I and for some years thereafter, the annual production declined to about 2 million
                        ounces. When the price of gold was raised
                        from $20.67 to $35 an ounce in 1934, production increased rapidly and again exceeded the 4-million-ounce
                        level in 1937. Shortly after the start of
                        World War II, gold mines were closed by the War Production Board and not permitted to reopen until 1945.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>From the end of World War II through 1983, domestic mine production of gold did not exceed 2 million
                        ounces annually. Since 1985, annual production has risen by 1 million to 1.5 million ounces every year.
                        By the end of 1989, the cumulative output from deposits in the United States since 1792 reached 363
                        million ounces.</p>
                    <h3>Consumption of Gold</h3>
                    <p>
                        Consumption of gold in the United States ranged from about 6 million to more than 7 million troy ounces per
                        year from 1969 to 1973, and from about 4 million to 5 million troy ounces per year from 1974 to 1979,
                        whereas during the 1970's annual gold production from domestic mines ranged from about 1 million to 1.75
                        million troy ounces. Since 1980 consumption of gold has been nearly constant at between 3 and 3.5 million
                        troy ounces per year. Mine production has increased at a quickening pace since 1980, reaching about 9
                        million troy ounces per year in 1990, and exceeding consumption since 1986. Prior to 1986, the balance of
                        supply was obtained from secondary (scrap) sources and imports. Total world production of gold is estimated
                        to be about 3.4 billion troy ounces, of which more than two-thirds was mined in the past 50 years. About 45
                        percent of the world's total gold production has been from the Witwatersrand district in South Africa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The largest gold mine in the United States is the Homestake mine at Lead, South Dakota. This mine, which is
                        8,000 feet deep, has accounted for almost 10 percent of total United States gold production since it opened
                        in 1876. It has combined production and reserves of about 40 million troy ounces.
